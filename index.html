	<h1>I am Azher Uddin Tonmoy</h1>
	<h2>I am a student</h2>
	<h3>I wanna be good hunman being</h3>
	<h4>Things can't, prayers heal your pain!</h4>
	<h5>Better days are comming.</h5>
	<h6>Work hard and believe in Allah.Allah is there to help you.</h6>

	<P>I remember how good school days were.There was a tension free life. No responsibility! Just focusing a little bit in study because of family pressure and rest of the phase was enjoyment. We used to play cricket every morning and afternoon.There were friends who stood with us without any reason. I miss my childhood! wish we could turn back time to the good old days.</p>
